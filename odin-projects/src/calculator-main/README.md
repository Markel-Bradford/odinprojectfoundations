# Calculator

## Overview
This project is the culmination of the Odin Project Foundations course where you are require to apply all concepts learned to create
a basic, functional calculator. The layout was created using a flexbox grid with element created and appended to the index with a 
JavaScript function. The logic is handled by conditional and case statements to ensure accurate results.
## Features
The calculator can take in values and return the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Inputs can be made
via the keyboard or with mouse clicks on each button. All results will round to the nearest two places to contain result overflow. There is also a clear functionality bound to the Delete button, and backspace functionality bound to the backspace button.
